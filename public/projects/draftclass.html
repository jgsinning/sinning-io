    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>In the football video game's "Franchise Mode", one of the ways users build a football team is by drafting players
        from a draft class. The game allows for customized draft classes, but there is no way to easily edit the players
    in the class. Users must go through the in-game menus to edit player attributes. These menus can take a long time to
    load, are tedious to navigate, and users are limited to the speed of their controller inputs in adjusting
        player attributes.</p>
    <p>This latest version of the game overhauled the scouting system, which is how users learn more about players
    before they draft them. The new scouting system is flawed in several ways, spawning game modifications to make the
    process easier for users. Even with such mods installed, users can only learn an approximation of some of a player's
    attributes.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>The Draft Class Tool allows users to export a draft class from game files into a CSV file, view and edit the
    contents of the CSV, and import the CSV into a properly formatted draft class file to be used in the game. This
    can greatly reduce the time required to edit a draft class. Users can also see the exact values of certain
        attributes instead of the game's approximations, allowing them to bypass the flawed scouting system.</p>
    <p>Currently, not all player information is supported (see <a href="https://github.com/jgsinning/draft-class-tool">
        GitHub</a> for more details). This tool is not a replacement for the in-game editor, but it assists users in
    editing most of the attributes that affect game logic.</p>
